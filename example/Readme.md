The turotial on how to visit the cloud GPU is in User Tutorial.pdf.

File list:

1.	Fig-3b.ipynb: The process and display of image feature extraction in DLPFC for #151673, corresponding to Figure 3b in the paper.

2.	Fig-5e-demo.ipynb: Displays the cross-platform integration of Stereo-seq and Slide_seqV2. Due to platform GPU memory limitations, this is a sampled version with 7000 random points from each dataset. The results in the paper are provided in another training file.

3.	Fig-5b.ipynb: Displays the results of horizontal integration, corresponding to Figure 5b in the paper.

4.	Fig-5c.ipynb: Displays the integration based on slices from different sources in the DLPFC, for Figure 5c in the paper.

5.	Fig-5a.ipynb: Displays the integration of adjacent DLPFC slices #151675 and #151676, with an ARI of 0.64, corresponding to Figure 5a in the paper.

6.	Fig-5d.ipynb: Displays the integration results from the MERFISH platform for two mice on the same site, corresponding to Figure 5d in the paper.


7.	ARI0.68-Spatial_clustering-151673-img.ipynb: Displays the clustering results based on image similarity for #151673, with an ARI of 0.68.
