File list:
1.	Fig-3a.ipynb: The process and display of image feature extraction in DLPFC for #151507, corresponding to Figure 3a in the paper.

2.	Fig-3b.ipynb: The process and display of image feature extraction in DLPFC for #151673, corresponding to Figure 3b in the paper.

3.	Fig-3c.ipynb: The process and display of image feature extraction for human breast cancer, corresponding to Figure 3c in the paper.

4.	Fig-5e-demo.ipynb: Displays the cross-platform integration of Stereo-seq and Slide_seqV2. Due to platform GPU memory limitations, this is a sampled version with 7000 random points from each dataset. The results in the paper are provided in another training file.

5.  Fig-5e-inpaper-A6000.ipynb: Displays the cross-platform integration of Stereo-seq and Slide_seqV2 (Trained on A6000). Corresponding to Figure 5e in the paper.

6.	Fig-5b.ipynb: Displays the results of horizontal integration, corresponding to Figure 5b in the paper.

7.	Fig-5c.ipynb: Displays the integration based on slices from different sources in the DLPFC, for Figure 5c in the paper.

8.	Fig-5a.ipynb: Displays the integration of adjacent DLPFC slices #151675 and #151676, with an ARI of 0.64, corresponding to Figure 5a in the paper.

9.	Fig-5d.ipynb: Displays the integration results from the MERFISH platform for two mice on the same site, corresponding to Figure 5d in the paper.

10.	ARI0.65-Spatial_clustering-151673-gene.ipynb: Displays the adaptive clustering results based on gene similarity for #151673, with an ARI of 0.65.

11.	ARI0.68-Spatial_clustering-151673-img.ipynb: Displays the clustering results based on image similarity for #151673, with an ARI of 0.68.
